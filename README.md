# NHL_Team_Origins
Welcome to your NHL Team Origins app! 

## Usage

To use NHL Team Origins, simply navigate into the app's directory and use 'bin/run' in your command line to run the app. Once the app is running, it will prompt you to select a team - use your up and down arrow keys to select the NHL team you'd like to visit. Afterwards you will be prompted to whether you'd like to select from the main menu of teams again, or if you'd like to exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
